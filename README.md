# PanGenoGrapher - visual analyzer for pan genomes via graphs

PanGenoGrapher is a web-based tool for analyzing PanGenome graphs visually. The tool is based on [Visu*all*](https://github.com/ugurdogrusoz/visuall), which in turn is based on the [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org) library.

A sample demo deployment can be found [here](http://ivis.cs.bilkent.edu.tr:5200/).
